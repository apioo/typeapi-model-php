# About

This library contains the official auto generated models to represent a [TypeAPI](https://typeapi.org/) or [TypeSchema](https://typeschema.org/) specification.
The model classes can be used to build i.e. code generators or other tools which need to process a TypeAPI or TypeSchema specification.
